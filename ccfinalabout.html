   <p> THE CONCEPT STEMS FROM MY JOURNEY FROM MY HOME IN LITTLE HAITI, MIAMI TO LIVING FOR A TIME IN SOHO,
     A PLACE WITH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MIX OF CULTURES AND PEOPLE AND HOW I DEALT WITH HAVING NO CONNECTIONS AT THE TIME IN THE CITY.
     THEN SHORTLY AFTER I MOVED TO THE AREA THAT I LIVE IN CURRENTLY TO STAY WITH A FRIEND, I SPENT MUCH OF THAT TIME EXPLORING AN AREA
     THAT COINCEDENTIALLY BECAME MY FUTURE HOME ALONE OR SPENDING MY TIME RECONNECTING WITH A FRIEND I’VE HAD SICE MIDDLE SCHOOL I HAD
     GOTTEN OUT OF TOUCH WITH. I BREIFLY THEN TRAVELLED TO MY HOMETOWN TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY AT MY JOB GUARDING THE DOCK AT
     A PARK NAMED MORNINGSIDE. I THEN AFTER LOOKING FOR A PERMANENT APARTMENT SETTLED ON A ROOM IN CANARSIE. LITTLE TO MY KNOWLEDGE
     IT LIED AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY FROM SCHOOL. I TOOK UP STAYING IN MANHATTAN AT MY CURRENT ROOMMATE BEN’S DORMROOM BECAUSE OF HOW EXCRUCIATINGLY
      LONELY LIVING ALONE AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY WAS. I SPENT THE WHOLE SUMMER AT AN EX’S HOUSE BEFORE BUYING MY FIRST APARTMENT
      IN BUSHWICK ONLY LEAVING TO MIAMI FOR MY GRANDMOTHER’S PASSING. DIRECTLY AFTER MOVING MY STUFF IN, I WENT ON A CONTEMPLATIVE TRIP
      TO MAINE IN WHICH I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MYSELF. I HAVE NOT TRAVELED FROM MY BUSHWICK APARTMENT SINCE THEN. WEBSITE SHOWS EVENTS FROM THE PAST WEEK AND A HALF.
